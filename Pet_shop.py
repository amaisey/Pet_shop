# OOP Pet Shop Assignment for IS 403

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter in the number of customers for your Pet Boarding company. You
# do NOT need to store each customer in a list since we haven't talked about that yet. However, you need to
# implement this using classes.


# Customer Class:
    # Instance variables:
        # cust_id of type string
        # first_name of type string
        # last_name of type string
        # sAddress1 of type string
        # sAddress2 of type string
        # sCity of type string
        # sState of type string
        # zip of type string
        # fBalance of type float (How much they owe)
        # cust_pet of type Pet (In a class diagram when the arrow from the pet class points to the
        # Customer class that indicates that a Customer object "has a" Pet object. So you will need to include
            # cust_pet (or some name that you want to use) so that the Customer object can hold a pet object. 
            # Since there is just an arrow it indicates it is a one to one relationship. 
            # In IS 401 you will see that you can include multiplicity to indicates the number relationship (0 to 1, 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many, etc.).
    # Methods:
        # Constructor should:
            # receives first_name, last_name, sAddress1, sAddress2, sCity, sState, and zip and store
            # those values to associated instance variables
            # initialize fBalance to 0.0
            # initialize the cust_pet to None
            # calculate the cust_id by calling gen_id method passing first_name, last_name, and
                # sAddress1. Make sure there are no trailing or leading spaces in the passed values.
                
        # gen_id() receives the first_name, last_name, sAddress1 and takes the first 3 letters from
        
            # the first name, first 3 letters from the last name, and first 5 letters from the address 
            # to create the cust_id and returns that string value which when called will be assigned back to the cust_id attribute in the Customer class
            # Replace any spaces in the string with no space ('')
            # note: In the program, do not prompt the user to ever enter the cust_id. It is generated
                # from the logic above.
        # return_bill() will return the following string (not print):
            # If the user entered greg for the first name and anderson for the last name and
            # 2677 east 1000 south for the sAddress1, the output would be:
            # Customer greand2677e with name greg anderson owes $123.50 for charlie's stay from 10/01/2020 to 10/20/2020
            # Where greg is the first_name, anderson is the last_name, 123.50 is the fBalance, charlie is the pet, 10/01/2020 is the begin date, and 10/20/2020 is the end date
        # make_payment() should receive a float value and subtract the amount from the fBalance
        # attribute and update the fBalance attribute o ClassVariable:
        # ï‚§ company_name is of type string with the value of Critter Watch

# Your company has some strange business practices in that a Customer can only have 1 pet. And the way your
    # program is set up, you only keep track of the latest boarding of the pet with a begin and end date and a cost per
    # day based upon the pet.
# Create the necessary classes represented in the diagram above. A customer has a pet and a pet has an
    # appointment.
# Also, the company name is Critter Watch and that should be stored as a class variable that all Customer objects
    # can access.
# Have the user input the data for the customer into variables and then call the customer constructor passing the
    # data to the constructor.
# Gather the data for the pet as variables and create the pet object and assign it to the cust_pet attribute for the
    # current customer object.
# Gather the data for the appointment as variables and call the set_appointment() method for the appointment
    # object in the cust_pet object in the customer object (Customer has a pet and the pet has an appointment).
# Print the current bill by calling the return_bill() method
# Call the make_payment() method and then print the current bill again calling the return_bill() method
# For those that want an extra 3 points on the assignment you can implement the pet attribute as a list and the
    # appointment attribute as a list.
    
# HINT:
# dBegin_Date = datetime.strptime(input("Enter Start date in the format m/d/y: "), "%m/%d/%Y")and make sure
# you use:
# from datetime import datetime.
# Otherwise if you use:
# import datetime
# then you have to use:
# dBegin_Date = datetime.datetime.strptime(input("Enter Start date in the format m/d/y: "), "%m/%d/%Y")
